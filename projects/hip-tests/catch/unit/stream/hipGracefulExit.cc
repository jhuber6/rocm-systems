/**
 * Test Description
 * ------------------------
 *  - Test for: "Don't wait on command completion if worker thread
 *    is destroyed" (rocm-systems PR#3790).
 *  - Spawns a subprocess that queues async GPU work and exits without explicit
 *    synchronization. Validates that the atexit cleanup path
 *    (__hipUnregisterFatBinary -> SyncAllStreams -> HostQueue::finish) doesn't
 *    hang when the worker thread is already dead.
 * Test source
 * ------------------------
 *  - unit/stream/hipGracefulExit.cc
 * Test requirements
 * ------------------------
 *  - HIP_VERSION >= 6.3
